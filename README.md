# Pi Web Custom

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](./README.ja.md) | [Русский](./README.ru.md)

> An independently maintained personal customization of
> [agegr/pi-web](https://github.com/agegr/pi-web), based on its official **v0.9.1** release.
> Upstream development history, copyright notices and the MIT license are retained.
> This is not an official upstream release; upstream changes are adopted selectively.

## Custom additions

- [Per-message model identity](./docs/model-identity.md): raw selected and server-returned IDs,
  with missing history explicitly marked as unrecorded.
- [Token usage dashboard](./docs/token-usage.md): historical totals, per-directory breakdowns,
  fork deduplication and server-side background refresh.
- [Workspace editing and file management](./docs/workspace-files.md): explicit saves,
  retained drafts, conflict checks and file/folder creation, rename and deletion.
- [Full-only search policy](./docs/adr/0004-full-only-search-tools.md): search tools in
  ordinary Web sessions are enabled only by the Full preset; profile-controlled
  subagents retain their separate resource policy.

See the [v0.9.1 integration notes](./docs/upgrades/v0.9.1-local.md) for scope, tests and known limitations.

## Run this custom version

Use Node.js 22.19.0 or newer. Build in a fresh checkout, never in a directory with an active dev server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xns0318/pi-web-custom.git
cd pi-web-custom
npm ci
npm run build
node bin/pi-web.js --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 30141 --no-open
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:30141`. If the port is occupied, choose another free port.
The local CLI accepts the same options described below; use `node bin/pi-web.js`
in place of the globally installed `pi-web` command.

Dependency installation includes a version/hash-checked SDK metadata patch for model IDs.
See [model identity maintenance](./docs/model-identity.md#pinned-sdk-compatibility-patch)
before changing SDK versions or disabling install scripts.

**This customization has not been published to npm.** The upstream npm commands
below install `@agegr/pi-web`, not the custom features in this repository.
Keep credentials, sessions, installed plugins and deployment backups outside Git.
Existing agent data can be reused via `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`; do not run concurrent
agent turns against the same session from multiple servers.

## Overview

Local browser UI for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Pi Web uses the same local configuration and session files as pi, so you can browse and resume conversations, run agent turns, configure models and resources, and inspect project files from a browser.

## Features

- **Session workspace**: browse, resume, rename, export, and delete conversations grouped by project, with running state, context usage, cost, and compaction details.
- **Token usage dashboard**: view today/7-day/30-day/all-time totals, daily usage, and model/project breakdowns from saved sessions, with fork-history deduplication, server-side background updates every 30s, and immediate manual refresh. See [Token usage](./docs/token-usage.md).
- **Two ways to branch**: **New session** creates an independent session file from an earlier message; **Edit from here** creates a branch inside the current session.
- **Project file tools**: browse/upload/preview files and inspect Git diffs; manually edit UTF-8 text with retained drafts and conflict checks, and create, rename or permanently delete files/folders within the current workspace. See [Workspace files](./docs/workspace-files.md).
- **Git worktrees**: switch checkouts from the sidebar while keeping sessions from the same repository grouped together.
- **Web-based configuration**: manage provider login and API keys, models, model tests, plugin packages, and skills without leaving Pi Web.
- **English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese UI**: Pi Web follows the browser language initially; language and theme controls are available in Settings.

## Upstream npm package (not this customization)

Pi Web requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer. Check your version with `node --version`, then run:

```bash
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

The CLI opens a browser after the server is ready. If it does not, open [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). Pi Web listens only on `127.0.0.1` by default.

If no model provider is configured yet, open the **Models** panel to sign in or add an API key.

To install the `pi-web` command globally:

```bash
npm install -g @agegr/pi-web@latest
pi-web
```

To update, stop the running process with `Ctrl+C` and run the same install command again. To uninstall, run `npm uninstall -g @agegr/pi-web`.

## Configuration

For port and hostname, command-line options override the corresponding environment variables. Either `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` disables automatic browser opening. Run `pi-web --help` (or `-h`) to print startup options and exit without starting the server. Unknown options exit with an error.

| Option or environment variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--help`, `-h` | Print startup options and exit | — |
| `--port <port>`, `-p <port>`, or `PORT` | Server port | `30141` |
| `--hostname <host>`, `-H <host>`, or `PI_WEB_HOSTNAME` | Bind hostname | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` | Do not open a browser automatically | Browser opens |
| `PI_WEB_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` | Disable Pi Web update checks | Unset |
| `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Additional exact proxy or custom hostnames, comma-separated | Unset |
| `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` | Enable browser password login; API clients may use Basic Auth with username `pi` | Authentication disabled |
| `PI_WEB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Session idle timeout in milliseconds, up to `2147483647`; `0` disables idle shutdown; invalid or out-of-range values use the default | `600000` (10 min) |

For example:

```bash
pi-web --help
pi-web -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0 --no-open
```

### Remote Access

Binding to a non-loopback address exposes an agent that can execute high-privilege actions. On a trusted LAN, require a long random password:

```bash
PI_WEB_PASSWORD='a-long-random-password' pi-web --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

Password authentication does not encrypt the connection. Do not expose Pi Web over plain HTTP to the internet; use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or a trusted VPN. If a reverse proxy sends an external hostname, add that exact name to `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. This allow-list does not change the address Pi Web binds to.

### HTTP Proxy

Server-side model and API requests honor the standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 \
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:NO_PROXY = "localhost,127.0.0.1"
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

## Notes

- **Agent data**: Pi Web reads pi data from `~/.pi/agent` by default, including session files under `sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`. Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to use another pi agent directory.
- **Filesystem access**: Pi Web must be able to read the agent data directory and the working directories recorded by its sessions. Run Pi Web in the same filesystem environment as pi when sharing existing sessions.
- **Shared configuration**: the Models panel uses pi's model, settings, and credential storage, so changes are visible to both interfaces.
- **File access boundary**: the file browser is limited to working directories selected in Pi Web and project or session roots it already knows about; it is not a general filesystem browser.
- **Git worktrees**: see [Worktrees in Pi Web](./docs/worktrees.md) for switcher visibility, worktree creation, and removal behavior.

### Downstream Session Context Menu

Electron wrappers and other downstream integrations can provide a session-row
context menu without patching `SessionSidebar`. Listen for the cancelable
`pi-web:session-row-contextmenu` browser event and call `preventDefault()`
synchronously when the integration will handle it:

```js
window.addEventListener("pi-web:session-row-contextmenu", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY, refresh } = event.detail;

  void openSessionMenu({ id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY }).then((changed) => {
    if (changed) refresh();
  });
});
```

The detail object contains `id`, `path`, `cwd`, optional `name`, pointer
coordinates, and a `refresh()` callback for actions that change the session
list. If no listener cancels the extension event, Pi Web preserves the
browser's native context menu. This hook is browser-side and independent of
Pi agent extensions.

### Extension Session Liveness

Server-side Pi extensions with detached work can prevent automatic idle
session eviction through the versioned global registry:

```js
const liveness = globalThis[Symbol.for("@agegr/pi-web/session-liveness/v1")];
const release = liveness?.version === 1
  ? liveness.register({
      name: "my-extension",
      sessionId,
      sessionFile: sessionFile || undefined,
      isActive: () => detachedJobs.size > 0,
    })
  : () => {};
```

Register once per active extension session and call the returned idempotent
`release` function on session shutdown, replacement, or reload. `isActive`
must be synchronous, cheap, and scoped to the supplied exact session id or
file. Provider errors fail safe by preserving that session. This lease only
affects automatic idle eviction; explicit shutdown and Stop fallback cleanup
still take precedence.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). Run the common checks with:

```bash
npm test
node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

Do not run `next build` or `npm run build` during normal development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the development server; leave builds for release work.
